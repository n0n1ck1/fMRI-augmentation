This is the repository for the "Augmentation of fMRI Images with Generative Models" paper.

fMRI_train.ipynb - main notebook to reproduce the experiments

china_close_mean_HCPex.npy, china_open_mean_HCPex.npy - new data from Beijing University

china_close_mean_ts_by_network_HCPex.npy, china_open_mean_ts_by_network_HCPex.npy - old data from Beijing University

ihb_close_mean_HCPex.npy, ihb_open_mean_HCPex.npy - new data from IHB

close_mean_ts_by_network.npy, open_mean_ts_by_network.npy - new data from IHB

the fmri folder - augmented data from new datasets

the fmri_old folder - augmented data from old datasets.

fMRI_augment.ipynb - the augmentation notebook. Automatically saves results in the fmri or fmri_old folder.

plot_functions.py, train.py, tscnn_classifier.py declare the necessary functions.

The rest of the notebooks are legacy experiments
